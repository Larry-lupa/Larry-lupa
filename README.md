- 👋 Hi, I’m @Larry-lupa
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and the technologies we can use to build solutions for the web.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Angular, Typescript, Javascript, mongodb, powershell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that aim to provide solutions for the web, where my knowledge can be useful and where I can collaborate with the community.
